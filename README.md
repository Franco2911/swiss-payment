**SwissPayment** is a PHP library to generate Swiss pain.001 XML messages (complies with ISO-20022).

## Installation

Just install [Composer](http://getcomposer.org) and run `composer require z38/swiss-payment` in your project directory.

## Usage

Have a look at `Z38\SwissPayment\Tests\Message\CustomerCreditTransferTest` on how to create a pain.001 XML file.

## Caveats

- Not all business rules and recommendations are enforced, consult the documentation and **validate the resulting transaction file in cooperation with your bank**.
- At the moment ISR and cheque transfers are not supported (for details consult chapter 2.2 of the Implementation Guidelines)
- The whole project is still under development and therefore BC breaks can occur. Please contact me if you need a stable code base.

## Contributing

If you want to get your hands dirty, great! Here's a couple of steps/guidelines:

- Fork this repository
- Add your changes & tests for those changes (in `tests/`).
- Remember to stick to the existing code style as best as possible. When in doubt, follow `PSR-2`.

If you don't want to go through all this, but still found something wrong or missing, please
let me know, and/or **open a new issue report** so that I or others may take care of it.
